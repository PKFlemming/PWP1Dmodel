Image 24: COARE temperature profile evolution for observed data (a), DPOT (b), DT02 (c), DT05 (d) and KPP adapted from (Bernie et al. 2005, fig. 2) (e). “Heat islands” ringed in black. Temperature scale is 0.5 °C higher for modelled profiles than observed to compensate for drift and aid visual comparison, except in (e) where the same effect is achieved by subtracting 0.5 °C from the values. Month labels in (e) have been clarified. DPOT, DT02 and DT05 refer to model runs using different criteria to define the mixed layer thickness. See report (also in this folder) for details.
