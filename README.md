# PWP1Dmodel
Object-oriented Python version of the Price-Weller-Pinkel one-dimensional vertical mixing ocean surface model The mathematical model on which this is based was developed by Jame F. Price, Robert A. Weller and Robert Pinkel, as described in their 1986 paper Diurnal Cycling: Observations and Models of the Upper Ocean Response to Diurnal Heating, Cooling, and Wind Mixing.

A previous Python version is available at https://github.com/earlew/pwp_python_00. Although it made significant changes, that version is still largely based on the earlier MatLab version, available at http://www.po.gso.uri.edu/rafos/research/pwp/, which was in turn heavily based on the original Fortran available at https://www.whoi.edu/science/PO/people/jprice/website/projects_upperocean.html. 
This Python version is somewhat different from the earlier one in that it is object-oriented and has a more streamlined front-end. At the same time, it was written for a univerity module where only analytical outputs were assessed, and no-one else was going to read the code, so it can be idiosyncratic or abstruse in places.
