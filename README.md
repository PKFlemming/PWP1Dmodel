# PWP1Dmodel
Object-oriented Python version of the Price-Weller-Pinkel one-dimensional vertical mixing ocean surface model  
The mathematical model on which this is based was developed by Jame F. Price, Robert A. Weller and Robert Pinkel, as described in their [1986 paper](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/JC091iC07p08411) Diurnal Cycling: Observations and Models of the Upper Ocean Response to Diurnal Heating, Cooling, and Wind Mixing. (Linked version is behind paywall; free versions are also available)
This model has been coded up before: originally in [Fortran](https://www.whoi.edu/science/PO/people/jprice/website/projects_upperocean.html), and then in 2001 in a [MatLab version](http://www.po.gso.uri.edu/rafos/research/pwp/) that closely followed the original. A previous [Python version](https://github.com/earlew/pwp_python_00) made significant changes to, but was still largely a translation of, the MatLab version.
This Python version is different from the earlier one in that it is object-oriented and adds a streamlined front-end. At the same time, it was written for a university module where only analytical outputs were assessed, and no-one else was going to read the code, so it can be idiosyncratic or abstruse in places.
